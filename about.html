          <h3>Hand-picked packages</h3>
          <p>
            You see a small set of deals with the key information upfront. Nights, board basis, transfers, and price.
            No endless scrolling.

        <div class="info-block">

          <p>
            Prices are shown as “from” because they can change by date and availability. You always see what is included
            before you enquire.

      <h2 id="story-title">Why Holidae was made</h2>
      <p>
        Holiday websites can feel busy. Too many pop-ups, too many filters, and too much text makes it hard to decide.
        Holidae focuses on a small number of strong deals and presents them in a calm way.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might browse on a commute and come back later to book. Holidae is built around that habit, so your experience
        stays consistent between devices.

        If this was a real service, you would be able to contact support, view terms, and manage bookings here.
